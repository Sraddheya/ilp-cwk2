# Informatics Large Practical Cwk2

The Informatics Large Practical consists of one large design and implementation project.

Learning Outcomes
1. Consider alternative algorithm designs and data structures for tackling a given problem.
2. Show awareness of the difference between design and implementation in software development.
3. Implement and debug a software system of medium to large size.
4. Design and carry out experiments and tests, and explain the methodology involved.
5. Write a well-structured report providing clear and concise documentation for a software project.

For this project, I have been asked to help the School of Informatics investigate an idea for a service which should allow the students in the School to make the most of their lunch hour where they take a much-needed break from lectures, studying, labs, and practicals. The School of Informatics is considering creating a service where students can place a lunch order for sandwiches and drinks and have these delivered to them while they take a break in Bristo Square or George Square. Lunches will be delivered by an autonomous airborne drone which will travel to sandwich shops in the University Central Area to collect the lunch items in a lunch order, and then fly to a chosen location to deliver these to the student who placed the order. My task is to devise and implement an algorithm to control the flight of the drone as it makes its deliveries while respecting the constraints on drone movement specified in this document.
